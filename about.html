                    <h1>About Us</h1>
                    <p>MyCandidateQuiz is a website built by two highschoolers based in Coppell, TX that aims to help individuals, regardless of their political background, feel confident in their candidate choice through a short and effective quiz.<br><br>We created MyCandidateQuiz to address a glaring issue that we noticed around us: many people struggled with understanding political issues and felt weak and uninformed in regards to voting in the Elections. Many existing tools were either too complicated or left users feeling frustrated and confused, so we set out to design a solution thatâ€™s quick, easy and effective. We hope MyCandidateQuiz helps you navigate the voting process with confidence and ease of mind.</p>
